The goal of this game is to destroy your opponent's item while avoiding your opponent's attacks.

In the game setup, you can choose your characters and set player 2 as a CPU player.
||At the start of the game, you will first set up the locations of your items in the following order

Large > Medium > Small
 
These items have 1-3 hitpoints corresponding to their size and are destroyed when they reach 0.
||At the start of your turn, select an item then choose a command or hit back to select another item.

Once a command is completed, a result box will be shown and can be clicked to end your turn.
||Attacking

Spaces around your chosen item will be highlighted and you may attack any of those spaces.

Your attack can hit, graze (adjacent hit) or miss the enemy items.
||Moving

Your items can move vertically or horizontally.

However, they cannot move to the same space as your other items.
||Other
